A humble starting boilerplate for awesome projects. I wasn't happy with any of the other million existing boilerplates, so I created this one is suited to my taste/skills.

## How to use ##
```npm start```  
Starts webpack-dev-server on localhost:8080  

```npm run build```  
Builds the assets and puts them into the build  folder

```npm run deploy```  
Builds the app and uploads the result to <user>.github.io/<projectName>/


## Future Plans ##
- Add javascript testing #2
- Add a way to handle image assets #3
- Add a way to handle font assets #4
- Add a way to generate favicons #5
- Get some normalize or base css styles #6
- Define env variables through an .env file #7
